# Employee Data Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Employee Data Management System** is a Python command-line application that allows users to manage employee records efficiently. The system uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, stores data in memory using dictionaries, and ensures **data persistence** by reading from and writing to a CSV file.

This project is designed to reinforce core Python concepts such as:

* Dictionaries and lists
* File handling using the `csv` module
* Functions and conditional logic
* Basic Command-Line Interface (CLI)
* OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Reusability)

---

## ✨ Features

The system provides a menu-based interface with the following options:

1. **Add Employee**

   * Add a new employee with ID, Name, Position, Salary, and Email
   * Data is stored in memory and saved to a CSV file

2. **View All Employees**

   * Display all employees in a readable format
   * Data is loaded from memory

3. **Update Employee**

   * Update employee details using their unique ID
   * Empty fields are ignored and not updated
   * Changes are saved back to the CSV file

4. **Delete Employee**

   * Delete an employee using their ID
   * CSV file is updated accordingly

5. **Search Employee**

   * Search and display employee details by ID

6. **Exit**

   * Exit the program safely

* **csv module** for file handling
* **Git & GitHub** for version control

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-data-management-system.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd employee-data-management-system
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
python employee_manager.py
```

## 📖 How It Works

### Start the Program

* The program loads employee data from `employees.csv` into memory.
* A menu of options is displayed.

### Perform an Action

* The user selects an option (Add, Update, Delete, Search, List, Exit).
* The program performs the requested operation.

### Save Data

* Any changes (add, update, delete) are saved to the CSV file.

### Retrieve Data

* When the program restarts, all employee data is reloaded from the CSV file.

## ✅ Validation & Error Handling

* Salary must be numeric
* Employee ID must be unique
* Invalid menu options are handled gracefully
* Displays appropriate messages for non-existing employee IDs

---

## 🧠 OOP Design

* Uses a single class: **`EmployeeManager`**
* Encapsulates employee data and related operations
* Easily extendable (e.g., add new fields or features)

---

## 🌟 Bonus Features

* Basic input validation (salary, empty fields)
* User-friendly menu and messages

---

## 📤 Submission Instructions

* Submit **only the GitHub repository link** via **Microsoft Teams**
* Do **not** upload any files directly
* Submissions outside the platform will not be accepted
